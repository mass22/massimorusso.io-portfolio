  I work with teams and organizations when technical decisions become structuring, difficult to arbitrate, or have long-term consequences.

  My role is not to deliver features, but to help **clarify**, **structure**, and **consciously own** technical decisions in contexts of complexity, legacy, and real constraints.

  ## What I Do

  ### Frontend Architecture
  I help evaluate existing architectures, identify points of fragility, and define realistic modernization trajectories.
  The goal is not a perfect rewrite, but an architecture that is understandable, maintainable, and aligned with the team's real capabilities.

  ### Consulting & Decision Support
  I intervene when several technical options are possible, but no clear decision emerges.
  I help structure criteria, clarify trade-offs, and document decisions so they are understood and assumed over time.

  ### Pragmatic AI
  I accompany teams when AI enters the discussion: product opportunity, market pressure, or internal initiative.
  My role is to identify relevant use cases, frame risks (costs, quality, dependency, security), and integrate AI without unnecessarily complicating the existing architecture.

  ## How I Intervene

  My intervention can take different forms:
  - targeted audits
  - decision support
  - technical workshops
  - ad-hoc support for senior teams

  It is always time-limited, decision-oriented, and designed to make the team autonomous.

  ## When to Call Me

  - A frontend architecture becomes difficult to evolve
  - Modernization is considered without a clear trajectory
  - Technical choices need to be arbitrated quickly
  - AI arrives in the roadmap without precise framing

  ## What I Don't Do

  - Long-term development or execution on a time-and-materials basis
  - Project management or operational delivery
  - "Turnkey" AI implementation without prior reflection

  ## What You Get

  - Clarified and documented technical decisions
  - A more readable vision of your architecture
  - A reduction in uncertainty and decision debt

  categories:
    - title: Intervention & Framework
      questions:
        - label: Do you still work as a developer?
          content: |
            No. My role today is focused on architecture, decision support, and strategic guidance.
            I can analyze existing code, but I don't work as a developer on a time-and-materials basis.
        - label: When should I call you?
          content: |
            As early as possible, ideally before irreversible technical choices are made.
            I also intervene when decisions have already been made and need to be reassessed.

    - title: AI & Modernization
      questions:
        - label: Do you offer turnkey AI solutions?
          content: |
            No. I don't integrate AI without prior framing.
            My role is to help decide if AI is relevant, where it adds value, and how to integrate it without creating unnecessary dependency.
        - label: Do you work with teams that are not AI experts?
          content: |
            Yes. What matters is not the initial level, but the ability to make informed decisions.
            I adapt my support to the context and maturity of the team.
