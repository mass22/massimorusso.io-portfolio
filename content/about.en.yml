description: Senior frontend architecture consultant and technical decision support. I intervene when decisions become critical, complex, or costly in the long term.

content: |
  I intervene when technical decisions stop being obvious.

  When a frontend architecture starts weighing on the team.
  When multiple options seem possible, but none clearly stands out.
  When a bad decision today can cost months — or years — tomorrow.

  My role is not to execute.
  My role is to help **decide**.

  ## What I do (and what I don't do)

  I don't intervene to deliver features.
  I don't intervene on a time-and-materials basis.
  I don't "reinforce a team" to produce faster.

  I intervene when:
  - strategic technical choices need to be arbitrated
  - a frontend architecture becomes difficult to evolve
  - complexity starts slowing down the product and teams

  My work consists of:
  - clarifying real options (not theoretical ones)
  - making trade-offs explicit
  - documenting decisions that stand the test of time

  ---

  ## Why this approach

  I've spent enough time in teams to know that the most costly problems are not always technical.

  They are often decision-related:
  - unclear choices
  - implicit trade-offs
  - directions never really assumed

  Over time, debt is no longer just technical.
  It becomes a **decision debt**.

  That's where I intervene.

  ## How I work

  I work with teams, not in their place.
  I ask questions that are sometimes avoided:
  - Why this option?
  - Why now?
  - What are we willing to sacrifice?

  I prioritize:
  - clarity over sophistication
  - collective understanding over individual complexity
  - readable architectures rather than brilliant ones on paper

  My goal is not to make the system "perfect".
  It is to make it **understandable, maintainable, and assumed**.

  ## About AI

  AI is everywhere in technical discussions today.
  Very few projects derive real value from it.

  I intervene to:
  - distinguish opportunity from trend
  - frame the risks (costs, dependencies, quality)
  - decide if AI is relevant, where it is, and where it isn't

  I don't sell promises.
  I sell **lucidity**.

  ## If you're considering working with me

  We're probably aligned if:
  - an important technical decision is blocking
  - the current architecture is hindering product evolution
  - you need an external, experienced, and independent perspective

  If you're looking for someone to execute or "keep the machine running", I'm not the right person.

  If you're looking to **clarify**, **arbitrate**, and **assume** complex technical decisions, then the discussion is worth having.
