content: |
  Some technical decisions cannot be made by intuition, nor by weak consensus.

  My role is not to decide for you.
  It is to help **establish a clear decision framework**, understandable and assumed over time.

  ---

  ## When to Intervene

  - several technical options seem valid
  - discussions go in circles without convergence
  - the decision is postponed due to lack of clarity
  - long-term consequences are difficult to assess

  ---

  ## What I Do

  - framing of real challenges and constraints (product, team, technical)
  - clarification of decision criteria
  - analysis of trade-offs and risks
  - formalization of a documented and shareable decision

  ---

  ## What I Don't Do

  - decide arbitrarily
  - "validate" a decision already made
  - provide simplistic answers to complex problems

  ---

  ## What You Get

  - a technical decision understood and assumed
  - an aligned team
  - a reduction in decision debt
  - a clear foundation to move forward serenely

  ---

  ## For Whom

  CTOs, Tech Leads, and product/tech teams facing structuring or blocking decisions.
