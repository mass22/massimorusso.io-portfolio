content: |
  Some technical decisions cannot be made by intuition, nor by weak consensus.

  My role is not to decide for you.
  It is to help **establish a clear decision framework** — understandable, explicit, and consciously owned over time.

  ---

  ## When to Intervene

  - several technical options appear valid
  - discussions go in circles without convergence
  - decisions are postponed due to lack of clarity
  - long-term consequences are difficult to assess

  ---

  ## What I Do

  - frame real constraints and challenges (product, team, technical)
  - clarify decision criteria and success signals
  - analyze trade-offs, risks, and long-term implications
  - formalize decisions in a documented and shareable way

  ---

  ## What I Don't Do

  - decide arbitrarily
  - rubber-stamp decisions already made
  - provide simplistic answers to complex problems

  ---

  ## What You Get

  - a technical decision clearly understood and consciously owned
  - an aligned team
  - reduced decision debt
  - a solid foundation to move forward with confidence

  ---

  ## For Whom

  CTOs, Tech Leads, and product/tech teams facing structuring or blocking decisions.
