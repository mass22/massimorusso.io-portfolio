content: |
  This intervention is for teams facing a frontend architecture that has become difficult to understand, maintain, or evolve over time.

  My role is not to propose an "ideal architecture".
  It is to help define an **architecture adapted to your real context**, your constraints, and your team.

  ---

  ## When to Intervene

  - the codebase becomes fragile or unpredictable
  - each evolution costs more than expected
  - a migration is considered without a clear trajectory
  - several technical choices are possible without consensus

  ---

  ## What I Do

  - targeted architecture assessment
  - identification of fragility points and real technical debt
  - clarification of viable options and their trade-offs (without dogma)
  - definition of a realistic, progressive modernization trajectory

  ---

  ## What I Don't Do

  - complete rewrite without justification
  - imposition of a framework or pattern
  - decisions disconnected from the team

  ---

  ## What You Get

  - a more readable architecture
  - explicit technical decisions
  - a realistic trajectory that is consciously owned
  - less debt... and less uncertainty

  ---

  ## For Whom

  CTOs, Tech Leads, and frontend teams facing structuring architectural decisions.
