content: |
  AI is everywhere in technical discussions today.
  Very few projects derive measurable value from it.

  My role is not to "add AI".
  It is to help **decide if AI is relevant**, where it truly is, and how to integrate it without weakening existing systems.

  ---

  ## When to Intervene

  - internal or market pressure around AI
  - uncertainty about real use cases
  - concerns about costs, dependencies, or risks
  - integration considered in an existing product or architecture

  ---

  ## What I Do

  - identification of use cases where AI brings concrete, measurable value
  - cost, value, and risk analysis (quality, dependency, security)
  - architectural framing and integration paths (orchestration, data, systems)
  - definition of clear technical and organizational safeguards

  ---

  ## What I Don't Do

  - integrate AI "to follow the crowd"
  - sell unrealistic promises
  - build opaque or uncontrolled systems

  ---

  ## What You Get

  - a clear decision on using (or not) AI
  - a controlled integration path if it makes sense
  - less technical and cognitive debt
  - a sustainable and understandable approach

  ---

  ## For Whom

  CTOs, product teams, and organizations exploring AI without wanting to lose clarity or control.
