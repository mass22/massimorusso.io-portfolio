    I'm a senior frontend architecture consultant focused on technical decision-making.

    I work with teams and organizations facing complex stacks, legacy systems, and long-term strategic choices — especially when AI becomes a product, technical, or organizational concern.

    My role is not to execute tickets, but to help structure, arbitrate, and secure decisions with long-term impact.

        I guide teams in the reasoned integration of AI when the question is no longer "is it possible?" but "is it relevant?".

        My role is to help decide where AI brings real value, frame the risks (cost, quality, dependency, security), and integrate it progressively into existing products and architectures.
      bullets:
        - Real use case identification
        - AI orchestration
        - Product integration
        - AI-assisted decision making

  categories:
    - title: Architecture & Technical Decision
      questions:
        - label: What's the difference between a senior developer and a frontend architecture consultant?
          content: |
            A senior developer focuses primarily on implementation and delivery.

            A frontend architecture consultant intervenes earlier: they help structure the stack, analyze existing constraints, compare options, and secure technical decisions with long-term impact.
            My role is to help teams avoid bad decisions before they become costly.

        - label: When should you call on a frontend architecture consultant?
          content: |
            When decisions become strategic: stack migration, significant technical debt, performance issues, difficulty evolving the frontend, or lack of clear vision.

            I generally work in contexts where improvising is no longer an option.

        - label: Do you only work on Vue.js / Nuxt projects?
          content: |
            Vue.js and Nuxt are my main areas of expertise, but my work focuses primarily on architecture and decision-making.

            The principles I apply remain valid regardless of the framework, as long as the frontend is critical to the product.

    - title: Advisory & Support
      questions:
        - label: Do you work as a consultant or as a developer?
          content: |
            I work primarily as a consultant and technical advisor.

            My role is not to take tickets but to help structure, arbitrate, and secure technical decisions alongside existing teams.

        - label: What does advisory support look like in practice?
          content: |
            This can take the form of architecture reviews, working sessions with CTOs or Tech Leads, targeted audits, or regular support.

            The format depends on the context, the challenges, and the level of uncertainty to reduce.

    - title: AI & Modernization
      questions:
        - label: How do you approach integrating AI into an existing product?
          content: |
            AI is not an end in itself.

            I start by identifying the real problems to solve, then evaluate whether AI brings measurable value.
            The goal is to integrate AI pragmatically, without adding unnecessary complexity.

        - label: Do you work on "from scratch" AI projects?
          content: |
            Rarely.

            I mainly work on existing products, where AI integration must coexist with an architecture, business constraints, and teams already in place.

        - label: Can AI really help with technical decision-making?
          content: |
            Yes, but only if it's used as a thinking aid tool, not as an oracle.

            I use AI to explore options, compare scenarios, and clarify trade-offs, while keeping final responsibility on the human side.
