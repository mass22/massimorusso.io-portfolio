    - title: Services & Process
      questions:
        - label: What services do you offer?
          content: |
            I specialize in UX/UI design and front-end development. This includes user research, wireframing, interactive prototyping, creating intuitive user interfaces, building responsive websites and web applications (especially with Vue.js/Nuxt.js), and developing design systems. My goal is to create seamless digital experiences from concept to deployment.
        - label: What is your design process like?
          content: |
            My process is collaborative and iterative, typically involving stages like Discovery & Research, Ideation & Prototyping, User Testing, Visual Design, and close collaboration with development teams during implementation. I tailor the process based on project needs, always focusing on user-centered solutions.
        - label: Do you work with startups?
          content: |
            Absolutely! I enjoy working with startups to help shape their product vision and create user-friendly interfaces from the ground up. I can adapt my process to fit the fast-paced startup environment.
    - title: Pricing & Timelines
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            Project costs vary based on scope, complexity, features, and timeline. For comprehensive UX/UI design and front-end development projects, my engagements typically start around $5,000, with average projects ranging between $8,000 and $25,000. For consulting or specific design tasks, my day rate is $700.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin work, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and Stripe.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and complexity. Smaller projects might take 3-4 weeks, while larger, more involved projects can range from 2 to 4 months. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.
